# QuietSpace

**QuietSpace** is a browser-based dwebpage for spontaneous writing and thought expression. Built using standard web technologies—**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**—it serves as a minimalist journaling space where users can freely record random thoughts, feelings, reflections, or internal monologues without the structure or expectations of traditional note-taking apps.

Unlike productivity-focused note tools, QuietSpace is designed to act as a personal venting space or emotional outlet. There are no folders, tags, or formatting distractions—just a clean space that auto-saves everything you write. The first note is permanently present and undeletable, acting as a starting point for every session.

## Features

- Note creation and deletion
- First default note is protected from deletion
- Autosave on every keystroke using `localStorage`
- Persistent storage across sessions
- Fully responsive and lightweight front-end experience

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structured the layout and content using semantic elements for clean markup and future scalability.
- **CSS3**: Styled the user interface to ensure readability, focus, and responsivenes.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Implemented all dynamic behaviors such as note creation, deletion, autosave, and localStorage persistence without the need for external libraries or frameworks.
- **Font Awesome**: Used for iconography to enhance UI clarity and functionality in the control tools.

## Project Purpose

QuietSpace was created to fulfill a simple yet often overlooked need of a non-judgmental, digital space where one can write freely and privately. In an age of over complicated productivity apps and cloud-based tools, QuietSpace stands apart as a personal writing retreat powered entirely by the browser.

Its goal is not to organize your tasks or ideas but to provide a place where users can type out their stream of consciousness, vent emotions, or relax mentally. It does not store your data externally; everything is kept locally in your browser, ensuring complete privacy and control.

## Usage

To use QuietSpace:

1. Open the QuietSpace webpage in any modern browser.
2. Start typing into the default note. It will save automatically.
3. Click the "+" button to add new notes as needed.
4. Use the save icon to force-save (though autosave is always active).
5. Delete notes using the trash icon—except the first note, which is locked by design.
6. Close or refresh the tab safely—your entries will persist until manually cleared.

No sign-in, no cloud sync, no distractions.

## Deployment

QuietSpace is deployed using **GitHub Pages** and is publicly accessible.
